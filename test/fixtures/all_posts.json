In fact, when I first moved to San Francisco last June, I lived in an <span style=\"FONT-STYLE: italic\">actual box -- </span>a room the size of a converted shower stall. So I consider myself an expert on leading a minimalist lifestyle (so as to fit inside the box), effective packing methods and most importantly now, the picking and choosing of roommates.<br /><br />If you happen to be in the market for shared housing and find yourself in attendance of an \"open house\" where you get to check out the place and its current inhabitants and see \"if you're a good fit,\" what you might hear is lots of this:<br /><br />Current roommate to the roommate prospect: \"So what do you do?\"<br /><br />Prospect to current roommates: \"What do you guys do for fun?\"<br /><br />Current roommate to the roommate prospect: \"Well, there's a cat... so, you'd have to be ok with that. Is that ok?\"<br /><br />Prospect to current roommates: \"Do you guys like, hang out? Or do you guys pretty much stay in your rooms?\"<br /><br />And there will be lots of tittering. Do not forget to titter. It is very important to titter if you are to be taken seriously as a candidate for the open room. Especially in San Francisco. Housing is very hard to come by there, so extra tittering may be called for. If you feel things are going particularly well, that the roommates have especially taken to you, feel free to let a chortle loose. Use your good judgement.<br /><br />Back to the issue of roommate selection. I have learned that this is a very large part of what makes your home life a happy and comfortable one. That and the appliances that are available for use in the kitchen. If your future roommates seem to think the absence of such appliances is a good representation of them sticking it to The Man, but you feel Hot Pockets are the reason for your existence, you should seriously reconsider this living arrangement.<br /><br />I would advise to skip over questions like \"What do you do for a living?\" and \"Do you cook a lot?\" It should be readily apparent if they take hallucinogenic drugs professionally and if they don't appear to look like Dave Chappelle's signature crack addict, then you will come to find out their occupation and what they can cook best later. Other things will start to come out eventually too, but to avoid awkwardness or resentment in the future, I've compiled a list of things you should ask about upfront, before talk of how much the security deposit is.<br /><br />1) Are all of the roommates living in this dimension? (This question will help ascertain the mental state of the roommate you are currently talking to.)<br />2) Do any of the other roommates <span style=\"FONT-STYLE: italic\">believe</span> that they are living both in this dimension and another one? (This one will help determine the mental states of the other roommates' living in the house.)<br />3) Have you ever caught a roommate talking out loud to himself or muttering under his breath and then upon being caught, explaining himself with \"Don't mind me, I just do that 'cause it helps drone out the voices in my head?\"<br />4) Will the cat wake me up in the middle of the night by throwing its body full force against the bedroom door?<br />5) Will it stare at me for far too long and much too intently, as if to tell me it's possessed?<br />5) Will there be long email strings between the roommates from those seeking compensation for knives I never used?<br />6) If you see an 18-pack of beers in the fridge, and you know you did not buy them, would you drink them all? What if there were a bag of Rice Krispy treats that were not yours... would you eat every last one and when confronted, answer with \"I was stoned?\"<br />7) While I am away on vacation, will you let strangers sleep in my bed?<br />8) While I am away at work, will you let dogs or other animals deposit their feces in my room and on my carpet?<br />9) Do you normally wear your jacket inside?<br />10) Is there a reason why it's 62 degrees in here?<br /><br />I've always considered myself an easy going, easy to get along with roommate, but after looking back at all that's happened, maybe I'm not. Maybe I expect too much, maybe I am too normal, maybe I walk the line of being a boring person too closely. But alas, that is who I am, and maybe if that's you too, you will find this list helpful in your housing search.","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"3854888141850316015","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b3c","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b3d","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b44","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2008-02-01T20:27:00-08:00","updated":"2008-02-03T22:27:17-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2008/02/london.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2863715959618205266","title":"Crumpets, pounds and the Crown Jewels: a trip to London","content":"<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/R6awHc-t0LI/AAAAAAAAACs/jbprEWTGQog/s1600-h/big+ben.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px;

Almost immediately we were enamored. One day, after my brother and I had gotten back from the optometrist's office, we discussed our new found awe and inspiration, our desire to also be optometrists. What was not to like about a job that let you visit different people who sat still in a chair while you moved different lenses in front of their eyes as you asked \"1? Or 2?\" or \"1? Or two?... 1? Or two? Or about the same?\" Even at the tender age of 10, I recognized a cushy job when I saw one. And I was sure I could ask someone if lens 1 or 2 made things clearer just as well as they could, if not better.<br /><br />Now fast forward 15 years...<br /><br />The morning of my eye appointment, I was thinking of ways to get out of it. It's not that I'm not all for my visual health, I am. But I have become much more self-conscious and things probing close to my eyes or machines blowing unexpected puffs of air in them are unsettling. And just because I wear contacts doesn't mean that I should like these things or somehow be better able to handle them, because it's not the same <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">at all</span>.<br /><br />\"So just don't go,\" I'm told.<br /><br />It's specifically the eye dilation part that I don't want to have done.<br /><br />\"So just tell him you don't want to do it,\" I'm advised.<br /><br />Aside from the annoyance of the blurred vision and increased sensitivity to light that dilation causes, I am bothered that my optometrist doesn't look at me. And I find it hard to find it within myself to tell a man who doesn't look at me that I don't want him to put the drops in that will paralyze my ciliary muscles.<br /><br />It seemed we would like each other on that first day we met, having both gone to the same high school and college. Lots to talk about -- me and my stint on the high school swim team for 5 days, he and what it was like when the school was only one classroom big, when they rode horses to class... But there is something about a medical professional who doesn't look at his patients that makes the situation odd and uncomfortable-feeling for the not-looked at patient.<br /><br />As I'm waiting in a room for the doctor, it's a great surprise when he walks in because it's another doctor entirely. He asks me which contacts I've decided upon, and when I tell him, he declares what a good choice I've made. He says it with such gusto that I feel as though I have solved some ancient riddle that has long been waiting to be figured out or done long division quickly and efficiently in my head.<br /><br />We then move onto other matters of importance related to my eyesight -- he shows me his nice pen with a self-molding grip (it has his name printed near the top and carries an impressive weight when held). I tell him about advertising and explain my time in market research before moving back to the bay. We discuss the property he bought in Florida that has since gone down the hole but will come back, and come back strong when it does, as it's water-front property.<br /><br />Then he asks if I like what I do. I tell him I enjoy it. He says \"good\" and that's the important part -- that I don't mind going into work. He starts to scribble notes on my chart in the incomprehensible marks and scratches of pen point to paper that doctors use in writing things where clear script would be helpful, like prescription strengths or lab orders.<br /><br />I am quiet as he writes. I want to make sure he is writing what he means to write. Then I ask him if he likes being an optometrist. He says he does, continues scribbling. (All the while I'm thinking <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">He sure is writing a lot, I must be blind. Maybe he is writing special directions that need to be written in the charts of those who are exceptionally hard of sight</span>.)<br /><br />I want to ask him if he wakes up in the morning and just wants to go to work, that if given a choice of doing other things he would still choose coming into work. He tells me that he retired a few years ago, after owning his own practice for 32 years and liked being an optometrist so much he stopped being retired and came back to work.","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"1073119065923553642","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b1e","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b1f","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b20","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2008-03-23T10:20:00-07:00","updated":"2008-03-23T12:22:26-07:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2008/03/amazing-part-of-it.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2076087969357450118","title":"The Amazing Part of It.","content":"There are, to be sure, many amazing things to be found and felt in this world.  They run the gamut of the internet, instant mashed potatoes<a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/R-asinL3_uI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/Ax80fRHC3FE/s1600-h/Idahoan_Instant_Mashed_Potatoes_Baby_Reds_t.gif\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/R-asinL3_uI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/Ax80fRHC3FE/s320/Idahoan_Instant_Mashed_Potatoes_Baby_Reds_t.gif\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5181018131970653922\" border=\"0\" /></a>, the changing of the seasons, Trader Joe's, public libraries, childbirth, Randy Jackson's America's Best Dance Crew, modern medicine and the all-knowing, omnipotent Perez Hilton, to name a few.  But perhaps one of the most amazing things that can happen is when one realizes the truth of the adage \"You learn something new everyday.\" In my own recent experience, I have found that this \"something new\" actually relates back to myself, making my realized adage \"You learn something new <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">about yourself</span> everyday.\"<br /><br />It is true that it bothers me when the kitchen floor sticks and crunches like that of a fraternity house. And never have I been a fan of the rain when it soaks my pant legs up to the knee and makes my socks wet, squishy and cold inside my shoes.  Stop and go traffic unsettles my stomach. But never would I have imagined the way my skin would crawl every time my housemate makes a seemingly so innocent comment about my dinner choices.<br /><br />From Monday to Thursday night, it is a great race to get through the week efficiently and quickly with as little harm as can be managed.  It can be tough squeezing in all the things one needs to do, wants to do, talk about, hang out with, see, enjoy and partake in.  One solution I have found to help in this balancing act that is known as the work week is my perfection of \"quick fix\" meals.  Although they are quick and easy and ready in the wink of an eye, they are by all means true meals offering great nutritional value, achieving the right balance of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, you name it.  At least this is what is promised to me on the sides of information-delivering packaging.<br /><br />A meal in the heart of India? Instantly transport yourself with Naan and bengal lentils in 10 minutes!  Looking for more variety? Spice things up with near-instant pad thai with veggies and peanut sauce over the stove. With such a wide offering of such tremendous, flavorful, nutritious cuisines, Trader Joe's ready-t0-eat and easy-to-prepare foods can hardly be considered your run of the mill frozen TV dinners.<br /><br />My housemate disagrees. Every night there is hovering.  And every night, as he hovers while I cook, he asks questions, too many questions -- \"What's that?  Is that that bread thing you made the other day? What's that white stuff? I've never seen that before.  Whatcha making? Whatcha having? You eat weird things.\" And always, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">always</span>, his barrage ends with some variation of \"You really like frozen foods don't you?\"<br /><br />As happy and grateful as I am for the research and development team at Trader Joe's, this one question has the ability to ruin it all for me. But it's OK because at least I now know this about myself, that this nightly question is a trigger for ruining a night's meal.<br /><br />I see no other way around this problem than the solution I have come up with -- I will just have to have a t-shirt made.  It will come in a neutral color and will match the rest of my wardrobe.  I will simply point down at my shirt and will no longer need to brace myself in preparing to answer calmly. I will just point down to the front which will say \"Yes, I am making naan again.  That white thing is tofu. And p.s. the answer from last night is still the same -- yes, I like \"frozen foods (if you can even call it that).\"\"","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"2076087969357450118","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b21","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b22","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b29","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2008-03-03T22:38:00-08:00","updated":"2008-03-03T23:37:33-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2008/03/31-flavors.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/1166707218589973714","title":"31 Flavors","content":"It was my craving for something rich, creamy and sweet, for something that had a name like \"chunky jamoca coca\" or \"smore'gasbord,\" that led us to pull on our jackets and climb into the car.  When we got there, I decided I wanted to see just what the 31 advertised flavors of the night were and so read the names of each kind of ice cream and its description and then looked up to see if the tub of ice cream matched the image the description had painted in my head.<br /><br />Strawberry cheesecake or vanilla cream with a swirl of caramel ribbon? Ooh, tough choice.  Finally, I settled upon a yogurt variety, promising 30% less fat, but all the flavor!  So I ordered one scoop and laid down my $2 gift certificate and one quarter (for tax).  The man behind the counter stuck a spoon in the side of the scoop, placed the cup of ice cream before me and said, \"You can keep that.\"<br /><br />I tore my eyes from the mound of creamy-goodness and looked at him.  I can keep that?  Of course I would keep it!  Safe and sound in my belly where it rightly belonged! And now if he would just take my gift certificate and give me back my 7 cents change... and I pushed my crumpled, dog-eared certificate a centimeter closer. Again, he repeated the same thing, \"You can keep that.\"<br /><br />A moment passed before it finally registered with me that he meant to tell me that I could keep both the scoop <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and</span> the gift certificate -- for a later time perhaps.  I said \"thanks\" and retrieved my wrinkled certificate, but left my gleaming quarter sitting there.  I gave this another 2 cm. nudge towards him.<br /><br />\"You can keep that, too,\" he said, wiping his hands on the front of his apron (was he wearing an apron?  It seems right that he would be.) Quicker to learn what had happened this time, I thanked him again, dropped my quarter in the paper cup labeled with a Bic pen \"tips,\" grabbed my ice cream scoop up off the counter and whisked around.<br /><br />To Alan (who is waiting patiently behind me as he does not care for sweets) I do the nod-head thing, the thing that communicates clearly but succinctly, perhaps even discreetly, that a confusing transaction has just occurred and although I am not sure I entirely understand what just happened, it is good, for the current time being it is a good thing and we must make haste and take our exit of the store.  ...but he does not understand this head gesture and stops me as I am nearly running out of the store.  He wants to know what just happened, but eager to leave, to make away with my free scoop of lowfat Strawberry cheesecake yogurt with the bits of graham cracker crust, I do the quick head gesture once more, and without stopping to see if he is following me, I rush outside.<br /><br />Outside, the air is calm and cold and seems to break the spell of the free scoop of ice cream, of the man and his \"You can keep that's.\"  We get back in the car and we speculate what the motive was behind this act.  At first we are careful not to call it an act of kindness.  We  contemplate that he is flirting with me.  I rule this out as Alan was standing right next to me.  But then I put this possibility back on the table; perhaps he thought Alan was a friend, maybe a foreign exchange student who had been my pen pal and was now visiting in person.  Next we think that maybe since we are still dressed in the clothes we wore hiking earlier that day, the man behind the counter thought we were poor and took pity on us.  Alan added that since it was only me who got ice cream, with a gift certificate no less, that maybe it did make us look needy, as if we could afford only the one scoop.  Maybe my eyes looked too wide and I took too much time carefully selecting the one scoop I could afford.  I hypothesized that maybe he recognized some refugee-roots in me that he saw in himself and offered the free ice cream as a sort of refugee bond.  Then we conjectured that maybe he was special and could see into people's futures.  That maybe he knew our time of enjoying snacks and delightful treats was nearing an end and so was only doing his part to not change the future but to help us enjoy what time we had left...<br /><br />Then we turned out of the parking lot and started talking about soup.","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"1166707218589973714","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b2a","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b2b","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b32","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2008-02-18T19:46:00-08:00","updated":"2008-02-25T21:40:58-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2008/02/finding-truth-in-r-kelly-song.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6915397169211875436","title":"Finding truth in an R. Kelly song","content":"We fill the day's hours moving and shaking, shaking and moving.  Some days are filled with more moving and shaking than others.  Some days we partake in activities within specific hours: the Bewitching hour, the Twilight hour and for those seeking escape from the 9-5 grind, there is nightly corporate flight to Happy hour.<br /><br />Happening far too often for my own tastes, I endure episodes of my own personal Un-Happy Hour, The Bruno Hour.  It happens with a type of careless haphazardness, after the voice of vodka overcrowds and makes itself heard but before the crowds from closed bars and clubs have finished digesting their late night, post-drinking meals (usually within the timeframe of 1:00 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.).<br /><br />This \"hour,\" although termed an hour, can actually be as brief as 20 minutes of condensed communication bursts or can last for up to a few hours.  It is not marked by any one thing, as a new approach is often taken each time.  These range from his playing the innocent, to the aggressive, to the harassing, to the pleading, to the bargaining, in text message form. These days it is mostly text messages.<br /><br />As annoying as it had been, it stayed mostly at that, weekly annoyances from someone trying to make contact with me whom I did not want to be contacted by.  This changed one recent night when I was sound asleep and was awoken by a series of the Bruno phone calls.  The first thing I felt most bitterly, almost violently, was that I had been <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">needlessly</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">awoken</span> when I had just a moment ago been <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sound asleep</span>. Of my basic, instinctual urges, sleep holds the top spot in my list of priorities. When I don't get enough sleep, when things prevent me from getting my complete fill of this nourishment, I have a tendency to become extremely unpleasant. And Bruno had so rudely come crashing in that night with cymbals and triangles ringing.<br /><br />This was when something inside me threw its hands up and I wondered, even in my sleep-doused state, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Won't he ever get it</span>??<br /><br />The next morning, as I listened to the many messages he had left, I pictured Bruno as a two-dimensional print on a piece of paper.  And as I deleted the voicemails, one after the other, I pictured cutting him out of the paper... snip, snip, snip, a cut-out of the paper that is my life.  Listen, delete, cut. The frustration and anger I felt that night is now replaced with a sense of hope.<br /><br />I hope that the Bruno Hour episodes are coming to an end.  I hope that my silence will speak volumes.  And behind this hope lies my new found meaning behind R. Kelly's \"When A Woman's Fed Up.\"  If R. Kelly, a man that can put out a hit single time after time but lives a deviant, perverse life (do you really know anyone who would enjoy what he did?), can realize and come to terms with what happens when a woman's fed up, I have good faith that Bruno will too.<br /><br /><div>Sing it Kels...</div><div><br />\"When A Woman's Fed Up\" <br /><br />But now the up is down<br />And the silence is sound<br />...<br />Cuz when a woman's fed up<br />(No matter how you beg, no)<br />It ain't nothing you can do about it<br />(Nothing you can do about it)<br />It's like running out of love<br />(No matter what you say, no)<br />And then it's too late to talk about it<br />(Too late to talk about it)<br /><span style=\";font-family:Verdana;font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><br /></span></span></div>","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"6915397169211875436","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b33","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b34","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000b41","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2008-02-03T20:00:00-08:00","updated":"2008-02-05T23:18:56-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2008/02/when-you-get-caught-with-your-pants.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8194840340446856358","title":"When you get caught with your pants down...","content":"Striped, large floral, mini floral, cotton, lace-trim, boyshort cut -- anything offering full butt coverage and in a tastefully stylish or pretty pattern are a good pair of panties in my book. Bad day? Buy a pair of underwear! Stressed out? Buy a pair of panties! Celebrating a raise? Buy some skivvys!<br /><br />It's always been there. This affinity for intimates pushing me to purchase, and always afterwards, the same feeling. A quiet, but full satisfaction knowing that no one would know what undergarment delightfulness lay beneath my jeans except for me.<br /><br />This enjoyment of cute underwear reached its peak my junior year of college when I lived with my freshmen year, dorm-floor friend Sue. Never before had I met anyone else so into the various patterns and cuts offered by Victoria's Secret Pink collection. This was of endless amusement to the both of us -- each of us rushing into the other's room after scoring some particularly cute ones. We'd reach into the bag, toss aside the pink tissue paper -- so carefully caressing each pair -- and show off our latest goods. It was like show and tell in elementary school, but on another level. Sometimes I would show Sue a pair, and with a fire behind her eyes, she would open her underwear drawer and show me that she had the same exact pair. Then we would ooh and aah over our similar, smashing good tastes.<br /><br />Later, I came to wonder: what was the driving force behind our infatuation? Surely we did not just love pinks and stripes in comfortable, breathable 100% cotton for no good reason?<br /><br />The answer came to me last month, after being hit by a Pathfinder while crossing the street. The first thoughts that came to mind were to get out of the road and then to wonder if any bones were broken? was I bleeding? did I need to go to the dr.'s?<br /><br />Between junior year, graduating college and trying to find the next best thing to Pinkberry in the bay, wearing nice underwear had slipped further and further down on my list of important things to keep track of.<br /><br />Well, I did go to the dr.'s, riding an ambulance to San Francisco General strapped to some backboard rolly thing. With my eyes practically taped shut and tears streaming down, I could hardly see as I was rushed through the automatic doors. Just like on tv, a doctor began talking to me, the room full of interns and nurses and beeping machines.<br /><br />I'm Dr. such and such, he said. As he unwrapped my head from the backboard, I was finally able to open my eyes and looked up at the man speaking to me -- a man, as it were, not a day over 29 with perfectly tousled hair, sparking eyes and a wide, easy smile. Was I on the set of Grey's Anatomy? Soap opera-looking dr. aside, I couldn't forget that the reason why I was here was because I had just been struck down by some beastly sized vehicle.<br /><br />Next came something else I had also seen on TV. Another dr. appeared on my other side, direcly opposite from Mr. McDreamy-wannabe. They explained that they were going to remove my pants and that they'd have to roll me, to check my backside. I was going to be rolled to face the other dr. that just appeared. For about 5 seconds, I forgot about the shock and pain of recent events and my mind focused in on the fact that I had not done laundry in a long while, resulting in my putting on 5-year old underpants that morning with an ungodly hole spanning at least 3\" in diameter in the backside.

Last week my sister invited me over to her place for a surprise. She wouldn't give me any clues and told me she didn't spend any money. The suspense just about killed me. At first, I thought she planned to cook me dinner. But when I arrived she was just hanging out and snacking on hummus. My surprise, she told me, wasn't being delivered for a couple hours.\n<br />\n<br />\nWhile we waited, she made us breakfast burritos and kept getting interrupted by phone calls from the delivery person. The idea of a delivery person made me think she was giving me flowers, but I remembered she didn't spend any money. As the night went on, I got more and more anxious. Finally, the \"delivery man\" called and said the package was ready, but we'd have to walk to the end of the block to meet him. I followed her down the street, dying the entire time.&nbsp;<i>What could it be??!&nbsp;</i><br />\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ncLPgEXvBuw/UWtP8EryMnI/AAAAAAAATIY/Ah6Fzmc-jDQ/s1600/cookie+break.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"></a><i><br /></i>We walked to the end of the street into a dark parking lot. I saw someone walking towards us when I realized... it was my mom! She had driven down from Portland with my dad for a surprise visit. I was floored—I haven't seen them since Christmas!<br />\n<br />\nSurprises can be so much fun, don't you think?

I use <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H6E1PG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001H6E1PG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quilikhor-20\">Laura Mercier Mineral Powder</a><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=quilikhor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001H6E1PG\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" width=\"1\" />&nbsp;which is super easy to apply and provides natural-looking coverage. It wears really well all day, so even when you start getting a little shiny or sweaty (story of my life), your skin still looks pretty. Here's how I use it in my morning routine:<br />\n<br />\n1. First, I prep my skin by washing gently with water and applying moisturizer and a prescription acne gel.<br />\n2. Next, I sprinkle some powder into the cap.<br />\n3. Using a big fluffy face brush, I \"buff\" the powder in circles in the cap to break it down and get it to adhere evenly to the brush.<br />\n4. Then I apply the powder to my face using circular motions, concentrating on areas where I need more coverage (like around my nose and chin).<br />\n5. To finish, I apply a little bronzer on the apples of my cheeks, and that's it!<br />\n<br />\nI've converted three aunts and potentially the receptionist at my optometrist's office to this make up. If you're looking for a new no-hassle foundation, I'd highly recommend it.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<br />","replies_count":4,"blogger_id":"3832957012913960927","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000bc9","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000bca","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["beauty","To Wear"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000bd4","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2013-02-22T06:00:00-08:00","updated":"2013-02-22T06:00:12-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2013/02/restaurant-worthy-garlic-bread.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6472285004639227350","title":"Restaurant-Worthy Garlic Bread","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vcZqrS7C8-g/UScKZcOVZwI/AAAAAAAASvs/Tb-F0yf7rEU/s1600/cheesy+garlic+bread.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"restaurant-worthy garlic bread\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vcZqrS7C8-g/UScKZcOVZwI/AAAAAAAASvs/Tb-F0yf7rEU/s1600/cheesy+garlic+bread.png\" title=\"restaurant-worthy garlic bread\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FsEdH-2bBq4/UScKXCSOAhI/AAAAAAAASvk/h51B57_Upp0/s1600/vodka+pasta+sauce++copy.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"best garlic bread recipe\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FsEdH-2bBq4/UScKXCSOAhI/AAAAAAAASvk/h51B57_Upp0/s1600/vodka+pasta+sauce++copy.png\" title=\"best garlic bread recipe\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\nA few weeks ago, the grocery store was out of ready-made garlic bread, so I tried <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Yg3BY8\" target=\"_blank\">this recipe</a> for dinner one night.

I haven't written about difficult things in a while on Quiet Like Horses, but writing things down helps me process them. So, here's what happened last week...<br />\n<br />\n<a name='more'></a><br /><br />\nOn Monday, Alan got scary results back from his routine cancer screening. We spent the rest of the week waiting for him to get a follow-up scan and going crazy waiting for the results. Even though it felt like our world had stopped, everything else kept moving forward. We went to work, Alan went to school, I went to Cost Plus and looked at the exotic candies from faraway places. In the evenings, we'd try to forget. We'd put on a movie and have a pizza party.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the movies we watched was <i><a href=\"http://bit.ly/VBxdTC\" target=\"_blank\">Celeste and Jesse Forever</a>. </i>Have you seen it? The two main characters, Celeste and Jesse, are going through a divorce and at one point, Celeste excuses herself to go \"eat her feelings.\" It made me laugh. I'm a total emotional eater, too. It got me thinking about how we cope with difficult things, and how, for the most part, we do a remarkable job of keeping it together when we need to. So kudos to you, my dear reader, for all those times when you were strong and brave and helped someone through something awful. (Even if it meant you ate your feelings just a little bit.)<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday morning his oncologist, a pixie of a woman with cropped silver hair and a kind face, called with the results. She always called with news in a timely manner which made me like her very much. The good news was that the scan didn't show any signs of cancer. The bad news was that she couldn't explain the worrisome results from his cancer screening.<br />\n<br />\nWe sat on the couch and ingested what it meant. It felt better, but it still felt really scary. On my drive to work, without the movies and the pizza and all alone in my car, I felt a quiet tear slip down. It was followed by many more—an uncontrollable flood of fear and anger, punctuated by an ugly ragged breath.<br />\n<br />\nWe're in a waiting game now, with our fingers crossed that his next screening in a few weeks shows better results. Until then, we're trying to get back to business as usual (probably with a few more pizza parties) because that's what feels normal and safe. I hope to continue posting regularly, and I want to thank you for reading and for your continued support. All your comments and visits here mean so much to me.","replies_count":9,"blogger_id":"3801983758550138360","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000bde","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000bdf","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["the c-word","To See"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000be0","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2013-02-14T06:00:00-08:00","updated":"2013-02-14T06:00:08-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2013/02/happy-valentines-day.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7061299623698190294","title":"Happy Valentine's Day!","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C41krVGXZ58/URx2YQrCu7I/AAAAAAAASoE/x1TXsuL3rzI/s1600/margot.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C41krVGXZ58/URx2YQrCu7I/AAAAAAAASoE/x1TXsuL3rzI/s1600/margot.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XiYZFG54Syc/URx2aEETo2I/AAAAAAAASoM/IOAH5hO5Hjw/s1600/peter.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"707\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XiYZFG54Syc/URx2aEETo2I/AAAAAAAASoM/IOAH5hO5Hjw/s1600/peter.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></a></div>\nHappy Valentine's Day!

It’s a response to other people.” He also says that \"cracking up – even at a funeral or formal state event – isn’t all that unusual.\" (Which is comforting to know if it ever happened to you but would still be so terribly awkward!)

It's perfect for those days when you want to look just a teensy bit more made-up without trying too hard.","replies_count":2,"blogger_id":"6461759054707965451","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000c20","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000c21","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["To See"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000c22","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2013-01-09T06:00:00-08:00","updated":"2013-01-09T06:00:18-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2013/01/the-beauty-of-rain-boots.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/1060148184909983351","title":"The Beauty of Rain Boots","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6ehzXeZe3zU/UO0MWBuuBwI/AAAAAAAAR7o/4oxB2y1rcTg/s1600/hunter+boots+and+polka+dot+tights3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"hunter green wellies\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6ehzXeZe3zU/UO0MWBuuBwI/AAAAAAAAR7o/4oxB2y1rcTg/s1600/hunter+boots+and+polka+dot+tights3.png\" title=\"hunter green wellies\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\nIt's probably a good thing I live in California because I've never been a big fan of the rain. One of the biggest reasons why is I hate getting my shoes wet and having to walk around all day in squishy socks with cold feet.

Once we went to the grocery store during a crazy storm, and even after walking through ankle-deep lakes in the parking lot, my feet stayed bone dry! (Poor Alan—his pants got soaked up to his knees).

Growing up, my family would watch Home Alone every year, and I can't believe it still hasn't gotten old. Here's a list of my other favorites: Love Actually, Die Hard, Elf, Sleepless in Seattle, Home Alone and Edward Scissorhands. They make me feel warm and cozy every time. I plan on watching a few of these (and maybe a couple of new ones) while wrapping gifts this weekend.

It doesn't race because you think maybe, just maybe, someone's heard you praying every night right after brushing your teeth and has finally seen to it that the million dollar jackpot be delivered to you. No, your heart is racing because you are trying to move as quickly as possible, to undo the locks and to hurry inside before the bag <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">blows up </span>because all you can think is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Oh my god, someone has left a bomb on my doorstep. </span>Now, why I would even think I am important enough for someone to go out of their way to build a bomb for is beyond me. I must have artificially high levels of self esteem that peak when I spend too much time in stuffy hospitals.<br /><br />After stepping inside, I flipped on the porch light (can I call it that even though the light does not shine on a porch but just a spot of sidewalk which happens to be right in front of my door?) and used my foot to part the bag open. Would it be a snake? A pile of poo? The money? Could that much money even fit into one plastic bag like that? And then I see small spheres which very well could have been poo, but there was also a note, and something told me someone who would leave poo on my doorstep would not be so considerate as to leave a note with it. They were plums, hand picked plums from the tree in my neighbor's backyard. How nice of him... and here you thought it was a bomb!<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span><br /><br />Speaking of nice, so many people have been<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> so very </span>nice to me recently through this blog. First, it was the comments. Everyone likes comments, don't they? Especially good comments that involve detailed stories or even just plain ol' compliments are nice too. They amaze me because when I think about the comments I try to leave on other people's blogs, they end up sounding like I had half my brain removed right before dinner. If I read something funny, I might leave a comment like, \"So great! So funny! Har har! I'm a pirate! Ha, actually, no, I'm not. Heh... Heh...\" and then I will close my laptop up because even it is feeling awkward and uncomfortable and cannot bear it.<br /><br />Then after that, I got emails from people encouraging me to keep hope alive and wishing Alan and me all the best... something like that. I didn't pay too much attention except for at the end when they signed with things like \"Your friend.\" And then I started thinking maybe now with all these acquaintances I can become properly socialized and stop thinking plums on my doorstep are out to get me. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span>","replies_count":32,"blogger_id":"4470436323673185431","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a00092c","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a00092d","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000943","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-07-13T23:34:00-07:00","updated":"2009-07-13T23:58:15-07:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/07/movie-recommendation-delicatessen.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2166835152702703201","title":"Movie Recommendation: Delicatessen","content":"What I should have done tonight after coming home from visiting Alan in the hospital was pack for my trip to Arizona tomorrow. (Emphasis on the phrase <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">should have.) </span>It's supposed to reach a sweltering high of 112 degrees while I'm there, and I just want to know what the heck I'm supposed to pack besides underwear. Because isn't that all anyone would want to wear when it's 112 degrees out? The cool is supposed to be something bone chilling, something like 92 degrees, so I guess I could afford to throw in a tank top for good measure. But something tells me my boss and colleague would not appreciate trying to figure out next year's marketing plan with me sitting in nothing but my sweaty skivvies, so I've opened my suitcase up.<br /><br />That's pretty much as far as I got before I started watching a delightful French film called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Delicatessen. </span>It's about this endearing ex-clown who takes on a new job as an apartment building's handy man. The first floor of the building houses a butcher shop and the ex-clown falls for none other than the butcher's shy, pretty daughter. Except it's not an ordinary butcher... it's a butcher that murders people! 5 words to describe it: spooky (in the way that movies about people eating people usually are), Amelie-esque, cute, funny, dream-like. I knew I was going to thoroughly enjoy it just from the opening credits. (Does that make me shallow?) Anyway, it's on \"Watch Instantly\" on Netflix if you are a subscriber.<br /><br />While watching the movie, I decided to make a list of things to pack. And after the movie ended, I looked long and hard at my list and thought long and hard about how I should start filling my suitcase, but decided instead to watch an episode of MTV's <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">16 and Pregnant. </span>If you can't tell from the title, it's a show about a pregnant 16 year old and her journey through her pregnancy all the way to birth. I decided to watch it because it's not like I don't already have a strange, almost morbid, fear and fascination with pregnancy and birth.

What we didn't anticipate was that to make it through to the other side of the forest, we'd first have to gather all our wits and strength together and climb Mount Everest's cousin called Recovering From Surgery. June had been nothing but an achingly slow ascent over this beastly elevation.<br /><br />For the past month, it had been so confusing and heart wrenching to see Alan so completely different than his usual self, to see a broken body so unlike his normal one and his face almost unrecognizable save for the two huge blue pools of sad pain above his nose. But then there was the past few days when Alan had been doing remarkably well.<br /><br />We pretended like we didn't notice when people stared at him in public, like the bags and hoses and pumps spiraling out of the various parts of his body were just a fashion statement and the bags of fluids clipped to his sagging shirt no more interesting than a man's backwards fanny pack. We walked around the lake, we paid an exorbitant amount to watch <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Up </span>(worth every penny) and on Tuesday he even offered to make Sophie and me breakfast. Things were looking up to the point that I didn't come home to greet him, ready to burst with news of my day, only to immediately feel helpless and full of despair. It was like the clouds had parted and a bright, singular ray of light had shone upon us, smiling at us and singing, \"The end is near!\"<br /><br />But the ray lasted for only so long. This morning Alan was in a lot of pain again, as if a hand had reached out from the forest and snatched us back into its darkness, pulling us back to where we were 2 weeks ago. All of a sudden, the taste of better days -- of walking, eating out, swimming, watching movies -- has gone dull again. While I was at work hoping maybe it was just a morning bug, Alan was re-admitted to the hospital under the suspicion that he may have an internal infection of some sort. And with this new infection comes a new rip roaring pain, lighting a fire and excavating ruins in his belly.<br /><br />Please, please, please. Can we please be in the clear soon?","replies_count":2,"blogger_id":"3089909692719452527","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000959","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a00095a","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a00096d","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-06-11T20:45:00-07:00","updated":"2009-06-11T21:14:14-07:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/06/token-of-ultimate-love.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/870421621920543164","title":"A Token of Ultimate Love","content":"This week I have experienced a new type of exhaustion I've never known before. It's one of physical exhaustion and mental exhaustion and even exhaustion of exhaustion. Work has been busy, like someone all of a sudden turned the pace knob all the way up to break neck speed. After work, I pull full shifts at the hospital. I wear the same look as the nurses that pull 12 hour shifts so well that when nurses see me in the elevator they ask me if my shift is over. After the hospital, in the wee morning hours of the next day, it's time for facial expression and tone practice in front of the bathroom mirror. Here I practice sounding upbeat and positive. I fight looking frustrated or panicked and instead replace these looks with ones of delight and hope. Today's practice will require extra special attention to sounding hopeful because now even I am starting to worry. Today is day 9 of Alan's hospital stay and he has a fever of 102, which means that not a day has gone by where he hasn't had a temperature. We don't know when he will get to go home and although I tell him it's going to be just fine when he looks scared, inside I am beginning to worry that he might have to start having his mail delivered here. That we might have to arrange for special visitation rights for Bilbo to come spend time with him. That soon the nurses will realize that I come by every day and that they can stop taking care of him because I will help them do their jobs.<br /><br />The other day a nurse told me she was going to teach me how to change his wound dressing. This involved a wet to dry procedure, as they called it, and involved pulling out the dressing inside a gaping, bloody hole in his abdomen, only to stuff it back with new gauze. They call this \"packing.\" Now, there is love, and then there is packing someone's wound. Where the two meet is where a man will owe his girlfriend for the rest of his life.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SjHUKB6prEI/AAAAAAAABuU/PiF6ykMoyWc/s1600-h/DSCN2938.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 305px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SjHUKB6prEI/AAAAAAAABuU/PiF6ykMoyWc/s320/DSCN2938.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5346287501443705922\" border=\"0\" /></a>Alan and Bilbo spending some quality time together.<br /></div>","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"870421621920543164","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a00096e","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a00096f","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000973","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-06-07T16:44:00-07:00","updated":"2009-06-07T21:26:01-07:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/06/reading-faces.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2422712333333019618","title":"Reading Faces","content":"A formal study conducted by me over the past 5 days has officially concluded that the difference between a good nurse and a bad nurse is the range of facial expressions each type uses. Whereas bad nurses tend to maintain one static facial expression, regardless of what the patient is asking or how the patient is feeling, good nurses express a wide range of emotions, each customized to suit the present situation appropriately. Often, good nurses combine their different facial expressions with a matching change in speaking tone. It doesn't seem to be too hard of a task to master; it just involves the contraction of a few muscles here and there across the face. For example, when Alan is concerned about a particular issue, I notice that the good nurses draw their eyebrows together and pull them downwards in the middle, causing a slight wrinkle. They might follow this action with a slight <i>h</i><i>mm... </i>which, amazingly enough, communicates so much. It says to the patient, <i>Uh huh, I'm listening</i> and <i>I hear what you're saying, let me look into that for you</i>. <div><br /></div><div>But then there are the bad nurses, the ones that pretend to be hard of hearing and don't acknowledge what you say. Or the ones that seem to be terribly bothered by any and all requests you might have, even legitimate requests like \"May I have that Tylenol now for my 105 degree fever?\" These are the ones that must be reminded 5 times about checking your temperature or giving you medicine or finding out why the machine next to your bed is flashing red and beeping irately. These nurses don't make concerned faces. When you are dying and your face is twisted, they look at you and all they see is something insignificant -- you are a washcloth maybe or a comb left by the sink with a few loose hairs caught in its teeth. With their hardened faces and lumps of coal eyes, these nurses communicate <i>I wish I could roll you right out the window so I can go back to chatting in the hallway now about that great Thai food I just had for lunch.  </i></div>","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"2422712333333019618","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000974","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000975","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000976","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-06-05T22:49:00-07:00","updated":"2009-06-05T22:57:23-07:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/06/timepeace-bracelet.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8451400348132692778","title":"Timepeace bracelet","content":"After a wonderful dinner spent celebrating Denises' successful dissertation proposal and not eating Dorito crumbs in Alan's hospital room, I'm back.

Alan's roommate who has just checked out was a 300 pound, incredibly vocal, incredibly demanding man who had been in a terrible motorbike racing accident. Every 20 minutes we'd hear him wail, \"Mama! Mama. Mom! Turn on the fan. Turn it on now! It's hot in here Mama!\" I told my mom about the full grown man next to us with the 6 kids who still called out for his mom. But later I found out that his \"Mama/Mom\" was really his girlfriend, or \"his girl\" as he told the nurses. (Actually, that's still one of the scarier things: I hope after I have kids Alan's pet name for me doesn't turn into Mom or Mommy or any other form of Mother.)  <div><br /></div><div>From the two days that I've spent in Alan's hospital room though, the real scare is how the nurses don't listen or seem to acknowledge what you're saying but then forget about what they said they were going to do all together. This morning Alan called me at 5, 4 hours after I'd gone home, and told me that strangers he'd never seen before were treating him and that the nurses were trying to kill him. After hanging up bewildered, I lay back in bed and wondered if I could just go back to sleep, but because I know he would do it for me, I put a sweatshirt on and drove back to the hospital. </div><div><br /></div><div>When I got there, he had come down from the fever he had at 2AM of 109 degrees but was still at 103. He told me he had been paralyzed and couldn't move for 2 hours and the nurses wouldn't help him. So I started asking questions about why and which drugs he was on and the nurse looked right through me, like an annoying fly was buzzing around her, but not worth swatting at. A little while later she came back in and tried shooting more drugs in his IV. Which is when I told her to stop and started asking again about the drugs she gave him earlier. Her voice started to rise and she told me that these drugs were scheduled and that the doctors wouldn't tell me about every order change <i>which is fine. </i>All I wanted to know was if you had a patient who was obviously as high as a kite, convinced you were trying to kill him, and was paralyzed from all the narcotics in his system, <i>why would you try to sneak in and give him some more? </i></div><div><br /></div><div><i></i>At 7, all the baby faced doctors who could have walked straight off the set of Grey's Anatomy came in and crowded around his bed to check his wound. One turned to me and said they were mostly worried about infection at this point and would have to do blood work. And here we are near 5PM and no one has mentioned anything about the test results. And when we ask the nurses walking by, they all nod and say they will look into it, but no one ever does. I have lost so much faith in the good work done inside these walls.

There is not a lot of time reserved for small talk so I don't ask anyone how their 3-day weekend was. We get right to business. I take a seat, my dentist walks in, and then she begins the grueling 6 month ritual -- the teeth cleaning. <div><br /></div><div>I have developed a special way of sitting in the patient's chair so that to the outside observer, it appears as though I am comfortable, about to drift off to sleep perhaps. I grasp my hands together across my stomache, and it is this alone, the act of squeezing my hands together, that allows me to live through a visit to the dentist. I suppose if I didn't have any hands, I could express my pain and discomfort by making sharp squealing noises, but I imagine that would be very alarming to the dentist holding the pickaxe in my mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>Pain aside though, dentist visits are good for self reflection. They are one of the few situations in life where you don't feel the need to engage the person you're with, even when she is just 2 inches from your face. While having my gums ripped into, I thinkt about my saliva glands. And then I curse them. My dentist often tells me about how mineral-rich my saliva is and how this leads to excess plaque build up. (I don't do internet dating, but if I did, that is what I would write on my profile and can you imagine the winners I could get?) It sounds harmless enough doesn't it? But no matter how much I brush and floss, the build up continues. Which is why this morning she is using a few different pickaxes to chisel it all away. And in between switching from lighter pickaxes to the industrial-sized ones, she heaves heavy sighs.

I'm not at all complaining; her music was very nice. But the problem was that it's all acoustic.

But feeling wistful doesn't do the trick. The only real way to get me motivated for studying these days is to think about showing up to the high school reunion and still having my greatest accomplishment be that I co-founded the Environmental Action club, a school wide recycling program, with Nathalie, the second member in the club besides me.<br /><br />But seriously, I just googled Environmental Action and it's still alive!

We don't talk about them because we <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">really</span> want them. Because of that we talk about other things, safer things; these are the dreams and aspirations we believe will be easy for people to grasp and understand. But the real dreams are still there. They are the things we think about when we are out on long walks, when we are just about to fall asleep or when gazing out an airplane window to the miniature world below.<br /><br />Today I went to a diversity conference/info session for Stanford's Graduate School of Business. And there was one thing that stuck out above all else. It wasn't the fact that every other person was from Harvard or the fact that every third person had started their own non-profit to combat world hunger. What really made an impression was how candidly the current students and alumni talked about their passions and dreams. They not only revealed what their dreams were <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">to us, </span>but they had told the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">entire business school. </span>And in response, the whole school did not gasp in horror, but joined together to help them make their dreams a reality. One student's dream was to open her own gym. Another alum launched a <a href=\"http://www.mrthebarbershop.com/home/\">membership-only barbershop, lounge and wine bar. </a><br /><br />The whole time the panels were talking, I just sat there thinking, \"I didn't know you could dream <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">out loud </span>like that about <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">things</span> like that in business school!\"   If the point of the conference was to make me really want to go to Stanford (which I'm fairly sure it was), then it's safe to say that that mission has been accomplished.","replies_count":1,"blogger_id":"5500000018563738174","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000992","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000993","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000997","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-05-11T23:57:00-07:00","updated":"2009-05-12T12:53:19-07:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/05/sweet-nothings.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/4415709422358940830","title":"Sweet Nothings","content":"There was a time in my life when Friday nights were spent going out to bars and meeting new people. And one of the best things about going out and meeting new people was the pick up lines. I especially liked the pick up lines that left a slimy residue afterwards, because those were the ones I would rush home to relish with my roommates.<br /><br />My senior year roommate Keith really liked the response a guy once gave me when I lied about having a boyfriend to get him to go away. He said, \"Just because there's a goalie doesn't mean I can't score.\" (Because that is exactly what girls like to hear).<br /><br />But I suspect I heard the best pick up line ever in the history of Friday night parties at Irene's. It involved the yellow flower earrings I was wearing and had been wearing ever since I got them the other day. So snazzy yet simple and capable of adding a pop of color around the face. I liked them a lot.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SgkeStwc4eI/AAAAAAAABsk/QJwVDdOe0fM/s1600-h/Picture+1.png\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 280px; height: 320px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SgkeStwc4eI/AAAAAAAABsk/QJwVDdOe0fM/s320/Picture+1.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334828540466356706\" border=\"0\" /></a>And obviously Mr. Suave liked them too. I could tell right away he probably wanted a pair for himself. He said (and write this one down because I promise it will come in handy some day when you're trying to pick up on someone), \"Your earrings look like big balls of pus stuck to your ears.\" And then, after he had delivered that zinger, he sealed the deal with, \"I mean, in a good way.

If you're thinking it involves me in a big white dress and a 5-tier red velvet cake, you would be wrong. Instead, think of me in a suit at an all day conference for the bay area's IT leaders at the ever elegant and contemporary Four Seasons.<br /><br />The best part of the event is enjoying the lavishness and luxuriousness of the hotel. Even the smallest of the wait staff's actions say \"Extravagance.\" Right now I'm watching the woman in front of me use some sort of suction device hose to drain the excess water from the ice bucket at the beverage station. If that's not straight up luxury, I don't know what is.<br /><br />A guest just zoomed past me down the hallway on a segway. Imagine that! The indulgence of not needing to walk indoors! It is almost like riding in those motorized chairs at the grocery store, but with a fresh appeal.<br /><br />And the sinks in the bathroom border on ridiculous. They are half the size of my bathroom at home and completely flat, like a natural extension of the counter top except that they effectively catch the back splash from washing your hands. I can tell just by looking at them that they would be amazing for hand laundering my delicates. But seriously, you have to see them to understand, to understand how much I need these sinks, even if at least one, for my future home. A picture will be posted for your sink-viewing pleasure as soon as I get my camera.<br /><br />There are lots of other things too, like the way the staff talks in hushed but cheery voices, the way I can tell just one person I need something done and it is instantly taken care of, and the comforting coverage of the bathroom stall doors. The doors are made of solid wood and are full length, leaving no gap at the bottom or the top and offering complete privacy for one's bathroom needs. When you're inside you feel like you're in your own private water closet. You can't see anyone waiting in line impatiently right outside and no one outside knows what you're up to inside, enabling a stress-free bathroom experience.<br /><br />It is all just so sumptuous.","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"3199144089952117937","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009b3","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009b4","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009be","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-04-07T22:31:00-07:00","updated":"2009-04-07T23:34:15-07:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/04/explanation-for-crazy-talk.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8360008136654836489","title":"An Explanation for the Crazy Talk","content":"Yesterday, something happened that made me wonder if I am an eternal optimist or a delusional dreamer. I like to think of myself as just the happy-go-lucky/anything-can-happen-if-you-want-it-to type, but yesterday I couldn't be sure.<br /><br />Late yesterday afternoon, I looked down at my phone and saw that Denise had texted me with \"Ur blogger is on Oprah!\" I'm not going to lie and say that I thought rationally about that statement after reading it. Instead, for about 10, maybe 20 solid seconds, I thought <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">My blog is on Oprah? How did that happen? What did I last post about? Shouldn't the producers have given me some sort of advance notice? I mean, just a simple heads up would have been nice...</span><br /><br />Then the logical me broke through the happy noise and realized that by \"ur blogger,\" Denise was more likely referring to one of my favorite bloggers and not the Blogger blogging service I use. I almost looked around sheepishly to see if anyone had seen the crazy thought bubbles exploding out of my head a moment ago. (Good thing that hasn't been invented yet.)<br /><br />So today I woke up questioning if the rose tinted glasses I'm wearing are too heavily tinted. Why else would I ever think that my blog could be featured on the Queen of Talk Show's talk show?<br /><br />I was still thinking about it when Denise sent me something else. This time it was an email. The subject line read \"Archie's blog\" and the message contained but just one line, a link to Archie's blog. I'm not sure what I expected to find in his blog that would compel Denise to send it to me, but I had faith that there was a good reason behind it. Emails containing just one link should be for something self explanatory, like a good recipe for chicken noodle soup or a mini quiz which will grant you a wish if you forward it on to 5 more people. But there was none of that to be found. Archie's blog contained a few posts, the most recent of which were posted in 2007. They were movie reviews, and not even for any movies I have a strong interest in. This begged the question -- <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">why would Denise send this to me? </span><br /><br />But more importantly, it showed that I am not as delusional as I feared. I blame it on the cryptic and random messages Denise sends for my tendency to jump (albeit sometimes rather far) to conclusions. I have to make the best guesses I can to assign meaning to the things she sends. So even though I have no clue who Archie is and have no idea why I might find his blog interesting, I feel a lot better about myself knowing I'm not <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that </span>crazy.","replies_count":2,"blogger_id":"8360008136654836489","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009bf","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009c0","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009c4","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-04-03T10:56:00-07:00","updated":"2009-04-04T14:15:59-07:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/04/preparing-to-avoid-preparation-h.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/4829692787845256430","title":"Preparing to Avoid Preparation H","content":"It's a nice coincidence that I happen to enjoy the taste and texture of a large variety of fruits and vegetables. But the main reason why I have a banana at breakfast, an apple at lunch and spinach with dinner has a lot more to do than with taste alone. Actually, I think my body cries out for more broccoli because it needs those essential vitamins. (Like the little misunderstood boy who constantly craved salt because of a salt deficiency. And who ended up dying when he was deprived of it by doctors. That could be me, except that I would die from a B12 deficiency or something). That and I've been sufficiently scared into wanting to maintain my digestive system's health for the rest of my life. <div><br /></div><div><div>It started one day a few years ago while I was sitting in Irene's apartment reading a magazine. Someone else was also reading a magazine nearby, in the bathroom. He spent a good half hour reading his magazine and sitting in a position which had to have been putting a lot of pressure on everything down there. When he finished his business and came out with magazine in hand, someone else in the room exclaimed, \"That took a long time! You're going to get hemorrhoids!\" </div><div><br /></div><div>I had heard this word -- hemorrhoid -- before, and I remembered seeing a commercial for Preparation H, a hemorrhoid cream, on TV.<br /><br />\"That's how you get hemorrhoids?\" I asked.<br /><br /></div><div>\"Yup,\" the room said.<br /><br /></div><div>\"What exactly are hemorrhoids?\" I asked.</div><div><br /></div><div>And then Irene began explaining what they were, an explanation that would change my life forever.  </div><div><br /></div><div>\"It's when you spend too long on the toilet or try to hard to go and then your intestines get pushed out because you're trying too hard,\" she said.</div><div><br /></div><div>\"Your intestines can get pushed out?\" I repeated in disbelief.</div><div><br /></div><div>\"Yeah, that's why they always tell you not to strain too much.\" I had never known Irene to be an expert in bathroom matters, but that day she sure seemed to be the expert on the more serious issues of going #2.<br /><br />From the Preparation H commercial, all I could remember was the man on the toilet with the pained look on his face. And now I knew why. If you had hemorrhoids with your intestines spilling out, you would look like that too. Preparation H, a cream that promises to soothe the burning, would seem like a God send. But would a cream be enough?<br /><br />I don't think I went to the bathroom for a few days after that. It's safe to say that from that day on, I made sure to eat enough fibrous things so that I wouldn't have to worry about any intestine eruptions.</div><div><br /></div><div>And now, in addition to hemorrhoids, I worry about getting colorectal cancer like Alan or diverticulitis like Nathalie.

And to fill the time between now and then, there are some songs that really hit the summer spot. Spaceman by The Killers does an exceptionally good job of it.

It makes me wish that tropical islands (the real kind that are featured in movies starring Leonardo DiCaprio) were within driving distance, but were somehow far away enough and off such a treacherous stretch of road that not many others ever ventured out to it.

She is very concerned now that he will stop eating and will wither away into a bean stalk. For this very good reason, she takes every phone call to remind me to feed him canned soup. I have no idea where she got this recommended cancer patient staple from, and it seems rather odd coming from a woman who usually makes her own soups from the rinds of leftover summer watermelons. But because she has been down the road of radiation and chemotherapy before, I don't question her advice and I definitely do not tell her about the untouched, never thought of 5 cans of soup that have been sitting in the kitchen cupboard since I moved in. </span><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><br /><br />Her phone calls don't stress me out because I can tell her honestly that he is eating. A lot. It's amazing how much he can eat now and how it all seems to disappear into thin air. He is as thin as he's ever been, maybe even thinner than when he was running everyday. After the initial shock of seeing him eat every meal like he hasn't eaten in days, the next thing that holds me in awe is the fact that he even has an appetite at all. It's hard to believe he has any room left for actual food after watching him swallow the stomach full of pills he takes every day. The pill menagerie is sprawled all over -- across his desk, in the kitchen, by the bedside table -- in all different sizes and shapes, but each working to either stop or stunt something or the other. </span><br /><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><br />I really took note of the wild appetite the other night when he made grilled cheese sandwiches -- 3 for himself and 1 for me.

A <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">proven </span>technique even. I wouldn't have dared to add the adjective \"proven\" before yesterday (as before then it was more like a hunch), but I think after yesterday it is safe to say it has been proven to work at least once.<br /><br />So, here it is. The secret to getting someone to stay interested in you is this: don't do anything. Don't call them, don't pick up their calls, don't text them, don't email them, don't see them, don't do anything. Now, I must admit there is a catch. The catch is that it takes a very specific sort of person to still be interested in you even when you don't acknowledge them at all. Either the person is secretly an alien intent on capturing you for DNA studying purposes or the person is a weirdo. But, if that sort of thing is all small beans to you, this could work very well. As I mentioned before, it's worked for me at least once with a man that shall be called Charlie. After a few months of ignoring him, Charlie popped up again with incessant calls. A year later, he sent sporadic text messages. And yesterday, after a whole16 months of my doing-nothingness, he actually made another attempt at contact. Eerily enough, this time Charlie wanted to know (just because he was curious) where I live.<br /><br />This brings up another good point and proven technique. If you could care less about wanting someone to stay interested in you, but have been dying for a fool proof way to completely creep someone out, here it is: Wait until just about a year and a half goes by since last talking to someone you used to know and who is currently treating you as though you don't exist and then text her to ask her where she lives. It will either melt her heart (if this happens, she might be an alien) or prompt her to tell all her friends the next day how creepy you are over gchat in capitalized stretched out words like \"OHHH, i SOOOO have to tell you about this text.\"<br /></span>","replies_count":1,"blogger_id":"550522658961657773","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009ef","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009f0","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009f1","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-03-03T20:45:00-08:00","updated":"2009-03-03T21:16:34-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/03/well-wishes.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5310881323349304525","title":"Well Wishes","content":"<a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/Sa4OXV7-fJI/AAAAAAAABeA/i-3-tvyHuyA/s1600-h/waiting.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/Sa4OXV7-fJI/AAAAAAAABeA/i-3-tvyHuyA/s320/waiting.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5309196804904877202\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-family:arial;\">My mom has increased the frequency of her calls, and I know that it is mostly to check in on Alan.

Making frosting is one of them -- you have to whip it up just right to get it to that light fluffy texture. Another example is branding. Consistent branding can help better communicate a company's message and value to its consumers. But perhaps the biggest occasion in which consistency is important is at dr.'s visits. <br /><br />Alan's doctors all work at the same hospital and all of them are working to help him get better. For this, I am thankful for their long years in med school and the extra work it took them to specialize in gastrointestinal medicine or oncology. It feels good to know that they must see hundreds of cancer patients a year, all with a different story, all with a customized treatment plan; treating people is what these dr.'s do. It's their job.<br /><br />What gets me though, is that despite the fact that they are all seeing the same problem (Alan's cancer), they all see different things, or rather, different levels of things. This might be expected since they each do/look for/care about different things according to whatever specialization they have. It only becomes a problem when they speak to us about Alan's cancer and it seems as though they are all reading a page from a different book. The GI doctor who first broke the news said that the tumor wasn't that big. A few weeks later, the surgeon said that the tumor wasn't the biggest she'd seen, but also wasn't the smallest, and that the cancer was in stage 1b/2a. In passing, she mentioned something about lymph nodes. This morning, we visited the oncologist who informed us that since the cancer was present in the lymph nodes (so this is what the surgeon was talking about), the cancer was really in the 3b stage. Now, on a scale of 1-4 stages of cancer, it's quite shocking to go from a 1b/2a to a 3b in a week.

She will hand the dr. a different chart than the one he is already holding in front of him. He'll look at the report inside, smile at us, then point to the upper corner of the room. \"Smile!\" he'll say. \"You're on Candid Camera!\"","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"7739416077460262273","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009fe","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a0009ff","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a06","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-02-11T13:54:00-08:00","updated":"2009-02-16T14:41:43-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/02/possible-valentine-card-replacement.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7574127119969483017","title":"A Possible Valentine Card Replacement","content":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\";font-family:Arial;font-size:10;\"  >When it comes to the criteria for whether or not we should end a relationship with someone, we all have standards.

But then I thought she might just be going in for a routine check up and there was no need to be worrying people unnecessarily. I pondered over the color of the walls and then the tiles, and just when I was about to start mulling over the placement of the waiting room chairs, an important thought struck me. Behind a closed door close by, a doctor was giving Alan a tattoo on the clump of bad cells within him. Now that he has a tattoo, this could be the perfect opportunity for making my case for getting one myself.

There I became good friends with another fifteen year old named Ali, a vivacious and candid girl. During any down time, we would decorate pizzas slower, taking the time to spread the sauce more evenly. We'd also find ourselves having those deep, meaningful conversations about life that only fifteen year olds can have. One day, she asked me if I had any words that I thought were particularly terrible. I couldn't think of any that I harbored feelings of disgust for, so I told her no and asked her if she did.<br /><br />\"Beef,\" she said, sprinkling a fistful of beef crumble onto the pizza before her. \"Beef is such a gross word.\"<br /><br />I thought about that for awhile and for a long time afterward I could see her point. The way your mouth takes shape while saying the word <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">is</span> a little unsettling.<br /><br />Now, a decade later, I find myself thinking about her question again. Except this time, I know what my ugly word is. It's \"cancer.\"<br /><br />About a year and a half ago, I had my first memorable run-in with the word when I found out my mom had breast cancer. I had no idea what to think and in the quiet of the closet-sized room I was subletting in San Francisco, it shook me. I didn't know what cancer looked like, what treatments were available, what would happen next. In the even quieter calm of lying in bed in my teeny-tiny subletted room, my mind would jump faster than I could ask it to stop, and I cried when thinking about the possibility of losing her.<br /><br />On Thursday, Alan went to the dr.'s office for some test results, and I went into work. While waiting for the doctor he texted me that his throat hurt and he was pretty sure I was the one that got him sick. I rolled my eyes at my phone. A little bit later, he called me and when I picked up, I could tell something was wrong. He asked me to meet him. I asked him what was wrong; I asked him what the dr.'s said.<br /><br />\"I have cancer,\" was all he said.<br /><br />On the way home, I fell apart. When I saw him, I fell apart. There was lots of falling apart and regaining composure, only to lose it again soon after.<br /><br />A day or two later, when the falling apart had let up a bit, Alan commented on the scariness of the word \"cancer.\" I couldn't agree more. I would much rather prefer to hear, \"You just have a spot of bad cells here, but not to worry! We'll just snip it right out, give you a little friendly zap or two and you'll be as good as new!\"<br /><br />Tomorrow we find out the details on the spot of bad cells and the snipping it out bit.

It started some time ago when someone's dog decided the walkway leading up to my door would make a nice spot indeed for doing its business, and its owner also agreed with it, leaving the poo swirl as it was, decorating the cement. But maybe the owner forgot to bring a bag or maybe he had a lot on his mind and didn't notice.  Whatever it was, I let it go and eventually learned to walk around the poo pile.<br /><br />Last week, neighborhood relations got worse, as only relations can when they involve motorized vehicles and the questionable people who drive them. On my way to work one morning last week, I hadn't even made it out of my street when a red Jetta pulled out of a driveway and nearly crashed into my passenger door. If my memory doesn't fail me, I believe she was also talking on her cell phone like a good driver ought to. I should have honked, but when I didn't, I found that at the very least I wanted to give her a nasty stare, but she stalled behind me for so long, I figured she realized cell phones, idiots and red Jettas are never a good combination on her very own.<br /><br />A few days later, I walked out to my car and noticed a citation officer giving me a ticket. In the hopes that maybe he was writing up the person behind me, I slid past him and almost made it safely into my car when he came up to me. When he said \"You're blocking this man's driveway,\" there was no denying the fact that he was in fact talking to me. I looked at him, looked at my neighbor of three doors down who was standing, but not looking at me, on the sidewalk, and then looked at my car \"blocking\" his driveway. As intelligently as I could, I said that I didn't think I was blocking his driveway. The citation officer said \"You're a foot into his driveway.\" I wanted to say – oh so <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">badly</span> I wanted to say – \"Yea, but he has another 15 feet of driveway and it's not like he has very many customers anyway driving into his driveway, so I really don't see what the problem is.\"<br /><br />I also wanted to tell him that last night I had come home from a very long day of work (just trying to keep my job at the factory I was!) and after a long yoga session after that, all I wanted to do was park my car, get in my house and proceed to melt into the couch, but as luck would have it, there was no street parking available that night except for this rinky dink spot that I made work for all intents and purposes. But thinking that less is sometimes more, I kept that to myself and made a gurgly noise that indicated I could understand where the citation cop was coming from but at the same time said I was not necessarily accepting fault. As if he didn't hear my gurgly noise, the citation cop repeated, \"You're a foot into his driveway, so this man has the right to call me and have me give you a citation.\" Now let me be clear about this that the ticket police never come down my street. This crappy neighbor of mine went out of his way to look up the ticket police's number and had the nerve to ruin their breakfast and demand someone come over bright and early. Luckily, I think the citation man was more annoyed at being summoned here than he was at me for sticking a measly few inches into someone else's driveway, so he let me off the hook. <br /><br />This afternoon, an almost identical incident to the red Jetta lady happened, except this time a lady pulled out of a driveway right in front of me, so fast that I had to slam on my brakes to keep from crashing into her. I forgot to honk again, but this time I remembered to give her a dirty, dirty look. This would have been very satisfying, except for the fact that when I went to give her my death stare time slowed to a stand-still and instead of being shaken and frightened to the core like Red Jetta lady, this lady <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">smiled at me. </span>Do you know what that's like to have someone smile at you when you are trying to give them a much deserved death stare?<br /><br />Needless to say, I came home and immediately started looking for dogs to adopt that could start leaving huge piles of odorous, brown presents on doorsteps for all my neighbors driving red Jettas, red Accords or owning desolate and sad looking amplification stores.","replies_count":2,"blogger_id":"4450329806620082446","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a10","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a11","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a15","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-01-30T19:47:00-08:00","updated":"2009-01-30T19:54:16-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/01/web-celeb-25.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8255981589522471252","title":"The Web Celeb 25","content":"My favorite 2 bloggers are in the top 10 on <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/29/web-celebrities-internet-technology-webceleb09_0129_land.html\">Forbes </a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/29/web-celebrities-internet-technology-webceleb09_0129_land.html\">Web Celeb 25</a></span>!

Now some annoying internal clock wakes me up in a panic around 7 on weekend mornings, convinced it's doing me a favor by letting me know that I've overslept and will be late for work.<br /><br />But before, in high school, I could sleep for 12-14 hours a day. If by some strange chance I happened to wake up in the middle of the night (I was a very heavy sleeper) for some water or to go to the bathroom, I might run into my mom, also awake for some strange reason. If I were in an ABC family drama, this might have been the beginning of a story about a rare moment of quality bonding time between mother and daughter – my mom would be sitting at the kitchen table in her fuzzy, worn robe, staring down into the steaming cup of tea in front of her, lines of worry creasing her face. Then I'd appear, awake and looking for a glass of water. My mom's face would clear instantly upon the sight of me, a smile spreading across her face. I would say with concern, \"You're up late... Am I bothering you?\" Then she would shake her head, still smiling, pull out the chair next to her and say warmly, \"No, never. I always have time for you bumble bee.\" And then we would share the plate of cookies in front of me (they would be homemade oatmeal) and talk about how school was going.<br /><br />In reality, I never saw my mom when she was awake in the middle of the night. At least, not at first. Without any lights on and no visible signs of anyone drinking steaming tea, when I would wake up in the middle of the night and wander out of my room, it was hard for me to tell if I was the only one up. Because there were never any telling signs of anyone else being awake, I was constantly startled to find my mom was, in fact, awake too, sitting in the middle of the living room in the pitch dark, just sitting. Not making any noise and not drinking anything, the only sign of movement in the room was her blinking. It was downright creepy, but also fascinating. I used to secretly think that maybe she was a creature of the night, a vampire maybe? Then one morning she took all the mystery and excitement away. She told me she was envious of how everyone else had slept through the night; she hadn't been asleep for more than a few hours before she woke again and stayed awake until morning. That was when I learned of my mom's insomnia spells.<br /><br />I'm no expert, but it seems that the older we get, the less sleep we need and the more likely we are to be struck by bouts of insomnia. As a person who cherishes her rest, this frightens me. I know the evil person I can become on 5 hours of sleep. Insomnia has the potential to destroy me. Because of this, I've decided to start collecting bits of conversations and saving topics overheard – the only requirement being that they must be the complete opposite of excitement-evoking and should instead invoke the level of excitement one feels upon finding lint in one's pocket.<br /><br />I have two of these precious topics collected so far. And these are actual pieces of conversations I have heard. The first is a topic I heard being discussed by two elderly women sitting next to me in a cafe. The topic was duvet covers. Not duvet cover designs, materials or patterns. Not bargain duvet prices or sales. Not a story about a duvet that murdered its master. No, this conversation topic was about how long it took one of the ladies to put on her duvet cover that very afternoon. The extremely high level of difficulty of getting the comforter corners to fill the corners of the duvet cover was also touched upon, but mostly it was a play by play on the length of time it took to put it on.<br /><br />The second topic is about spice racks. Not about the best blend of spices to spice a rack of lamb or how to create a magic potion to get someone to fall in love with you. This conversation topic was about how to store one's spices. The myriad of ways! Did you know there are spice-storing methods to suit nearly everyone's particular needs?<br /><br />I hope that I will always sleep well, but if there comes a time when sleep doesn't come easy, when I must haunt my home in the dark like a vampire mother, then at least I will have these topics to draw upon and discuss with myself to ease me back to bed.","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"364927831621450055","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a19","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a1a","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Conversation Starters","Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a1b","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-01-27T23:13:00-08:00","updated":"2009-01-28T00:17:33-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/01/baby-faced.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5718825261697795789","title":"Baby-Faced","content":"Other than when I'm trying to hide a horrendous mountain of a pimple or when I'm eating extra saucy buffalo wings, I don't really pay too much attention to what other people might be thinking about my face. I'm aware that it looks somewhere between 16 and 21 and that people can guess my age more accurately if they have contextual clues to work with. For example, people at work think that I'm 20 or 21 because I'm not an intern so they conclude that I must have finished college somewhat recently. In the same vein, it's not common for them to see me swigging beers or taking shots while at work either, so that's why sometimes people guess 20 because they don't think I'm old enough yet to legally drink. However, if I'm just walking around by myself wearing nondescript clothes and not carrying any telling props, then I might pass for much younger.<br /><br />My job at work recently has been getting juicy. Among other things, it includes lots of editing, some writing and some event planning. Tonight I attended a dinner event whe<a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SYAUH8un7_I/AAAAAAAABZU/USp1DGTC2rM/s1600-h/Picture+8.png\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 182px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SYAUH8un7_I/AAAAAAAABZU/USp1DGTC2rM/s200/Picture+8.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5296255288581025778\" border=\"0\" /></a>re my job was to greet people and make pleasant chatter. It's weird how for once I really became aware of my age, a relatively young one compared to the average age of the table full of guests. When they talked about their kids who were college-bound or just finishing college, I talked about my sister, which is not quite the same. When they made jokes about how they started their careers on the Lisa computer, I smiled too, as if I understood just how much that dated them. They talked about wine pairings, their husbands, their career histories, emerging new technologies and their applications and about what they do now. It was fascinating, a world I could only smile and nod at.<br /><br />The lady sitting next to me told me she thought I had just graduated from college. One thing I can say that I like about being baby-faced is the shock value it will have when I'm 35 and  pushing around my baby in the park. People will pass judgment on me, presuming that I'm a 17 year old, unwed, uneducated, miserable teenage mother. And then my baby, who inherited the genes to look much younger, will sit up and surprise everyone by telling me about the conclusions she's recently drawn from Moby Dick (because I never did understand that book myself). In actuality, she'll be an exceptionally brilliant 12 year old who just <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">looks </span>like a toddler.

Mental health was a whole other issue, but physically speaking, I had never been so fit in my life. I ate a low-fat, high-fiber vegetarian diet (for the most part) and got regular aerobic exercise. I was running the fastest I'd ever run, was doing the most push ups I'd ever done and was building up my endurance to a fine peak with Billy Blanks' twice weekly Tae Bo classes. But for all the crunches I could do and regardless of how fast I could walk uphill, there were two things I physically could not (and still can't) do – touch my toes and do a pull up. </span>    <p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Touching my toes has been an unresolved New Year's resolution of mine for the past 3-5 years, before I finally gave up on New Year's resolutions entirely. It's funny the amount of disbelief people express when I tell them I can't touch my toes. When I told my sister, she said, \"But they're right there… See!\" And then she bent over to show me that she could do it, so why couldn't I? <span> </span></p>    <p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Doing a pull up was something I had been wanting to do since forever. If I had to give a more exact date for the start of this desire, I guess it might have started in the seventh grade during physical testing. It was the day we were all asked to do as many pull ups as we could. We were told that if we couldn't do a pull up (and I thought <i>Pshh,</i> <i>who couldn't do at least one pull</i> <i>up?)</i> we could do a flexed arm hang where we were supposed to hover with our chins just above the bar. When my turn came, I prepared to bust out 10 pull ups and rubbed my hands together like a gymnast applying chalk does before a routine. But to my horror, after grabbing hold of the bar, I found I could only pull myself half way up and try as I might, I couldn't go any further. The P.E. teacher witnessed my struggling and suggested that I do the flexed arm hang, or in my opinion,  the modified pull up alternative for weaklings, which is what I realized I was since I couldn't do a real pull up either.<br /></p>    <p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">These two physical weaknesses are always in the back of my mind. I think that I should stretch more, that if only I stretched for that much longer I could touch my toes. And I think that if I just lost 75-85 pounds, I might then be able to do a real pull up. </p>    <p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">So when Denise asked if I wanted to join her for yoga yesterday, a recent memory at a family gathering came to mind and I eagerly said yes. You see, one afternoon, after we each ate 3 helpings of lunch (or something typical like that),  Nathalie, Justin and I found ourselves crowded around a pull up bar in one of the cousin's doorways. We went in a circle to see how many pull ups each of us could do. I couldn't do any. I don't remember if anyone else did either because all I remember is that Denise suddenly appeared, rolled up her sleeves, gripped the bar and did 3 pull ups out of thin air.<br /></p><p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Shocked and utterly amazed at her impressive strength, we asked her how she was able to do them. She explained it, in complete seriousness, by saying \"Because I'm hella buff.\" (Which is a very funny thing to hear coming from possibly one of the smallest human beings alive (of a non-dwarf or non-midget stature)). Surprisingly, she attributed her hella buffness to yoga. Since then I have always been curious about this yoga she does–this workout/routine/series of stretches she does that promotes hella buffness–and knew I had to go see it for myself.<br /></p><p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SXApMF0CdmI/AAAAAAAABXE/xihPlT_dIM0/s1600-h/Picture+3.png\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 133px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SXApMF0CdmI/AAAAAAAABXE/xihPlT_dIM0/s200/Picture+3.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5291774849855944290\" border=\"0\" /></a>It should be noted that I've always been slightly skeptical of yoga. Mostly because when I think of it, I picture rich, shi-shi, fou-fou housewives–the ones you see shopping at Whole Foods at 2 in the afternoon wearing 4 carat rocks on their hands and sipping Starbucks nonfat lattes–as yoga's primary clientele, and I've got to admit that is a little off-putting. <a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SXAph1yB0CI/AAAAAAAABXU/m76SItZHmZ4/s1600-h/Picture+4.png\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 149px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SXAph1yB0CI/AAAAAAAABXU/m76SItZHmZ4/s200/Picture+4.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5291775223509667874\" border=\"0\" /></a></p><p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">But then yoga also brings to mind Birkenstocks, fresh vegetables, the ability to touch one's toes and Zen and peace and tranquility. I think I was never really able to reconcile the two ideas before, but this time the idea of actually being able to touch my toes and do a pull up won over everything else.</p><p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"></p>    <p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Denise does <a href=\"http://www.sherryhan.com/\">yoga with Sherry Han</a>, which I learned is a common thing yoga-goers will ask other yoga-goers – \"Who do you do yoga with?\" Yoga-goers are faithful to their yoga teachers, and they don't usually stray very far. On our walk to the studio, Denise prepped me on what the class would be like.<br /></p><p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">When we got there, I spread my mat out and sat with my bare legs stretched out in front of me in imitation of everyone else. Still watching my neighbors, I put my arms in the air, clasped my hands together and pointed my two index fingers to the ceiling.<br /></p><p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Sherry made her way around the room to greet people. When she reached me she stared in the direction of my ankles and feet. I followed her gaze and saw what she saw–swollen, stuffed ankles and feet, like sausages that had been soaking in brine. She grabbed at my ankles and touched the tops of my feet.</p><p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Too much salt. You need to stop eating so much salt,\" she said. I nodded. I was a little embarrassed but also pleased. Denise hadn't told me about the free nutritional consultation I'd get.<br /></p>        <p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I started picking up on the poses by watching the people in front of me. At one point we were in a pose on the floor with our heads turned to the side. As I held the pose, I noticed my neighbor looking at me so we smiled at each other and then we smiled some more. Just when I wondered how much longer we were going to need to hold this for because it was getting slightly awkward staring at each other, I realized that everyone was turned the way she was and I was the one with my head turned the wrong direction.<br /></p>        <p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">By the end of class, I had rid myself of my earlier kankles. I must have sweated out all my excess salt in those 1.5 hours. In fact, I have never sweat so much from posing or stretching in my life. Immediately afterward and into the next day, I felt a very distinct and different kind of soreness in my muscles, as if they were looser and tension-free, like all my body parts could now move as they were meant to.<br /></p>    <p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I could definitely see how Denise could get hella buff from yoga. Maybe yoga could help me get hella buff. Or even just touch my toes. </p><p style=\"font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"></p>","replies_count":3,"blogger_id":"2873825862730496537","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a28","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a29","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a2a","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-01-12T12:59:00-08:00","updated":"2009-01-13T00:08:11-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/01/because-my-face-said-so.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/4041158877794426620","title":"Because My Face Said So!","content":"A familiar scene: a parent asks their child to do something (or, equally as often, not to do something), only to find that her Mini-Me replica doesn't want to cooperate without hearing a good reason first. This prompts the kid to ask the question \"Why?\" followed by \"Why?\" and then by \"Why?\" then reasonably proceeded by \"Why? Why? But tell me why?\" to which the parent snaps in exasperation, \"Because I said so!\"<br /><br />When the delightful time comes for me to have this conversation with my own Crocs-sporting child, I'm going to have to change this expression to \"Because my face said so!,\" and she will know I mean it.<br /><div><br />My face has always been an easy-to-use color-coded legend for decoding my emotional state at any given time, but recently I'm starting to notice that I have less and less control over it. Sure, before, you could tell when I was happy, upset, angry, elated, excited, hungry, etc., but there was at least the one face I had that translated to neutral, to my feeling something not quite good nor quite bad and perhaps indescribable all together. Now my face only reads as happy, upset, angry, elated, excited, hungry, disappointed, frustrated, etc. and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">trying</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">to</span> look happy, upset, angry, elated, excited, hungry, disappointed, frustrated, etc. It's problematic not having a neutral face because when I know my face should look one way, it looks the complete opposite way and is not even capable of feigning mild disinterest.<br /><br />While riding on BART last year from San Francisco to Walnut Creek, I met a man who was of a questionable mental and personal cleanliness state. When I saw him walk by on the platform the first time, I knew I wanted to avoid him. When he turned back around and stopped right in front of me, I knew I had to avoid him, lest I should have an extremely irritating trip. The whole time while waiting on the platform, I thought me and Neutral Face were doing all right for ourselves, maintaining our neutrality and keeping the crazies at bay. It wasn't until we got on the train and he sat down next to me did I understand that I had been betrayed. By my own face.<br /><br />I wanted my face to exude a distant calm coolness. An expression that communicated that I would most like to be left alone, in my coolness, and that I didn't want any trouble, but if there were trouble, I had to give fair warning that somebody risked getting his feathers ruffled. But obviously, after 20 minutes of the crazy man talking incomprehensibly at me, I was sure my face did not say what I wanted it to. When the man started giving me high fives to signify to the whole train we were in cahoots together and began loudly condemning the lesbian couple sitting a few seats away from us, I'm pretty sure my Neutral Face was long gone and one that actually attracted crazy people had taken its place. This is what the new face said: I am really tired and not feeling like talking to anyone, especially not anyone crazy, but if you are crazy and in the mood to talk a lot and loudly, then please come talk to me, closely if you please, to teach me a lesson on how I need to appear more scary-looking when riding on public transportation in the future.<br /><br />Now, that was just my face betraying me with a crazy person. Recently, my face has started betraying me with important people, which is what made me think I should try to get a grip on the situation and try to bring Neutral Face back. Just last week, after a peak of frustration, I walked to the kitchen for a cup of water. (Kind of like how smokers go outside to suck on their cigarettes and inhale and exhale their stress away, I walk to the water cooler for refills and refreshing sips of hydration as part of my stress management.) Who did I run into in my moment of angst except for a big man on campus who should not know, should never really ever know, that I have reached a peak of frustration. As he turned to face me, I realized I didn't have enough time to run back from where I came, so I decided to stand there and to try to be as normal as possible. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Smile,</span> I thought. Smiling would make it normal. But I found that when I smiled it felt like my face was suddenly made of broken eggshells, and the longer I kept smiling the more cracks started to form. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br /><br />How are you? </span>he asked. I thought he might be referring to my cracked-up face, so I said <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Good. </span>(Because I couldn't think of anything else to say). And then I stopped smiling and started nodding, because nodding has yet to fail me. There is no other way to read nodding except to read it as, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Yes, I am good. Believe you me, I am so good! </span><br /><br />I don't think he bought it. He walked over, slung an arm over my shoulder and told me it was going to be an exciting year. Then he said<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">, </span>\"A recession is a terrible thing to waste.\" Which made me think about that anti-drug ad campaign from when I was growing up that had the slogan \"A mind is a terrible thing to waste.\" I don't think that's what he meant to get me to think about, but that's what I found myself thinking about. That and how to get Neutral Face back.<br /></div>","replies_count":0,"blogger_id":"4041158877794426620","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a2b","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a2c","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a2d","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-01-07T22:36:00-08:00","updated":"2009-01-08T22:53:34-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/01/difficulty-of-conversation-at-baby.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/3656425784922913449","title":"The Difficulty of Conversation at Baby Showers","content":"Today I went to a baby shower for someone at work who, you guessed it, is about to have a baby very soon. Here's the thing with baby showers -- in the spirit of celebrating the beautiful new life which is about to begin and the beautiful miracle which is about to happen -- everyone in attendance talks about their own experiences of bringing new life into the world. This includes, but is not limited to, the craving and consumption of McDonald's for a week straight, the suffering from complete and absolute nausea the following week, the change in hormones during the different trimesters and the flattening and widening of the feet. A large part of the conversation revolves around the yet-to-be-born's name, particularly the difficulty of picking said name and the special meaning behind each name in consideration. Shower guests will also be polled on which spelling is favored for each of the potential names -- Jennie with an ie or Jenny with a y?<br /><br />While everyone talks in a flurry with wide, excited eyes, I nervously eat the chips and salsa in front of me. I tune out of the conversation and think: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I didn't know about the feet</span>. I miss the transition into the next topic because I am still in disbelief of the idea of having even wider feet than I already have. Soon, the feelings of surprise turn into a sort of bitterness as I think about my precious pair of wide sized shoes I miraculously found at the old lady shoe store and that I had falsely believed I would be able to fit into and wear for the rest of my life.<br /><br />When I snap out of it our lunches have all arrived, and just as I'm about to dig in, someone asks the waiter for a diet coke and someone else starts talking about water.<br /><br />\"Did you guys feel it when your water broke?\" a water-breaker veteran asks.<br /><br />This seems to be another favorite topic judging from the myriad of responses offered. One person had their water \"trickle,\" another felt a pop, a mini-explosion if you will (which sounds a little worrisome, I envisioned a firework exploding) and one thought she had peed the bed.<br /><br />Quiet for far too long now, I wanted to chip in my two cents. But because I had never had any breakage of water, I offered an insightful question instead, one I hoped would show that I could relate to them, \"And, this water, is it like, water? Or is it like pee? Or, no. Maybe it's like something else all together?\"<br /><br />But of course, as we all know, babies only stay babies for so long before they turn into mini people. For some time after being born, they are easy to please, easy to make laugh and easy to love. But then, upon the realization that cooties might actually be a good thing and right around junior high, something terrible happens to the whole lot of them. And this was what was discussed next.<br /><br />\"I just don't know what's wrong with him. I mean yeah, he's 15 now, but still. These past few weeks he's just like, 'I don't care,' 'So?' 'Don't go in my room,' 'Leave me alone,' 'Don't touch me,' 'I don't want to talk about it.' Last night when I asked him to unload the dishwasher he told me he'd do it later and I said 'I asked you to do it now' and then he said that his friend was going to call him soon and asked if he couldn't just do it later? I told him no and made him do it right then, and now he's still mad at me.\"<br /><br />That reminded me of a time not too long ago in high school when my mom asked me to put away a stack of laundry and I felt that if ever there was an unreasonable request, that had to have been it. It really was the most unreasonable thing because I was right in the middle of watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and it wasn't even on commercial yet, it was right in the middle of a crucial scene, and couldn't I just do it in a minute?<br /><br />I almost relayed this story, happy to be able to contribute finally, before I realized I was relating to her son, not her, my colleague, so I sat back, ate some more chips and spent the rest of the shower shoveling in huge mouthfuls of my fish tacos which required long, drawn out moments of chewing silence.","replies_count":2,"blogger_id":"3656425784922913449","blog":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a2e","blogger_blog_id":"2360593805083673688"},"author":{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a2f","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"},"blogger_author_id":"06629562195146939698"},"labels":["Matters At Hand"]},{"_id":"51aecca3f9daa9497a000a36","kind":"blogger#post","published":"2009-01-05T23:06:00-08:00","updated":"2009-01-05T23:42:31-08:00","url":"http://www.quietlikehorses.com/2009/01/pinkberry-opening-date.html","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8141537308286534018","title":"Pinkberry Opening Date","content":"A reliable* source has revealed exclusively** to me that Pinkberry*** in Santana Row will open its doors on January 15, 2009****.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">*This source has been wrong once or twice before, so I should clarify that when I say she is reliable, what I really mean is that I am just really <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hoping </span>that this time she has gotten all her facts straight.<br />**If \"revealed exclusively\" means having the Santana Row concierge answer the same question I call her with every other day -- <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Is Pinkberry open yet?</span> -- then I think it is definitely fair to call this exclusive.

Today I was at Target and passed by some mini baby work out clothes -- mini baby workout clothes! They looked like they were for someone who is 9-12 months old. Do babies go to the gym at that age? I should look into this because here I am thinking that many babies are still trying to master the art of holding up their head at that age, not hitting the gym to beat their best time on the treadmill. But then I remembered this <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070530/strong_toddler_070530/20070530\">article about a Super Baby</a>, so if mine are anything like him, maybe I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">will </span>need to get them some fancy work out gear.<br /><br />Lastly (and this is very random), on New Year's Day, I found myself engrossed in the world of New York socialites. Being the avid Perez Hilton reader, I thought I might be more interested in the lives of socialites, but it turns out I'm not. I did think it was interesting though that there is a whole world of people who <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">are</span> obsessed with them.<br /><br />What triggered this interest was a show I have started watching (the name of which will be withheld to save myself some embarrassment). On the show, a socialite works for a famous designer and got me thinking \"What do socialites actually do??\" So I did a little google search and found this internet universe dedicated to documenting and capturing the mom<a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SWG2HPNpo5I/AAAAAAAABVU/GnEB4Hcv0xU/s1600-h/Picture+1.png\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 165px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/SWG2HPNpo5I/AAAAAAAABVU/GnEB4Hcv0xU/s200/Picture+1.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287707672968799122\" border=\"0\" /></a>ents of socialites' lives.
